## Experiences in the Programming 2 Module in the Second Semester

In the second semester of my studies, I delved deeply into the topic of data structures and algorithms in the "Programming 2" module. In this course, we not only acquired theoretical knowledge but also gained practical experience by programming various data structures and algorithms ourselves.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

A significant part of the course was understanding and implementing fundamental data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Additionally, we explored classic algorithms for data processing and manipulation, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Search algorithms (binary search)
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS)

By implementing these structures and algorithms, we developed a deep understanding of their functionality and application possibilities.

### Using JUnit Tests

Another crucial aspect of the module was quality assurance through automated testing. We learned how to create and use JUnit tests to verify the correctness of our implementations. This practice helped us to ensure that our data structures and algorithms worked as expected and were robust against edge cases.

Overall, the "Programming 2" module provided a comprehensive foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of data structures and algorithms, preparing us well for more advanced topics in computer science.
